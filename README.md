# clustRcheck

## Overview

This package contains statistical hypothesis testing for discovering the presence of more than one mode in cluster distributions.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with `devtools`:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Kawameicha/clustRcheck")
```

## Features

* Simple `dip` to calculate Hartigan & Hartigan's dip test for unimodality of an ordered vector.
* Compute Hartigan & Hartigan's dip test for unimodality for all clusters with `check_modality`.
* Build a heatmap with `heatmap_visual` where the results of the test are represented as colors.
